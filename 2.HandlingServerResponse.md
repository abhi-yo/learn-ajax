// After making a request you will recieve a response back.

xhr.onreadystatechange = nameOfTheFunction;
function nameOfTheFunction(){

}

xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
if(xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.Done){
//Everything is good the response was recieved.
}
else{
//Not ready yet.
}
}

->>Next step-
Check HTTP response status codes ofthe HTTP response. We differentiate between a successful AJAX call by checking for a 200 OK response code.

xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
//Process server response
if(xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.Done){
//Everything is good the response was recieved.
if(xhr.status ===200){
//perfect
}else{
//There was a problem with the request.
}
}
else{
//Not ready yet.
}
};
xhr.send();
//now you can do whatever you want with the data the server sent.
You have two options to access the data:

1. xhr.responseText - It returns the server response as a string of text.
2. xhr.responseXML - It returns the response as an XMLDocument object you can traverse wth Javascript DOM functions.
